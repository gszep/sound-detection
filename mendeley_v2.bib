abstract = {We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversar-ial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The train-ing procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1 2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference net-works during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

abstract = {This paper introduces WaveNet, a deep neural network for generating raw audio waveforms. The model is fully probabilistic and autoregressive, with the predictive distribution for each audio sample conditioned on all previous ones; nonetheless we show that it can be efficiently trained on data with tens of thousands of samples per second of audio. When applied to text-to-speech, it yields state-of-the-art performance, with human listeners rating it as significantly more natural sounding than the best parametric and concatenative systems for both English and Mandarin. A single WaveNet can capture the characteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch between them by conditioning on the speaker identity. When trained to model music, we find that it generates novel and often highly realistic musical fragments. We also show that it can be employed as a discriminative model, returning promising results for phoneme recognition.},

MusicNet consists of hundreds of freely-licensed classical music recordings by 10 composers, written for 11 instruments, together with instrument/note annotations resulting in over 1 million temporal labels on 34 hours of chamber music performances under various studio and microphone conditions. The paper defines a multi-label classification task to predict notes in musical recordings, along with an evaluation protocol, and benchmarks several machine learning architectures for this task: i) learning from spectrogram features; ii) end-to-end learning with a neural net; iii) end-to-end learning with a convolutional neural net. These experiments show that end-to-end models trained for note prediction learn frequency selective filters as a low-level representation of audio.},

abstract = {Synthesizing a genetic network which generates stable Turing patterns is one of the great challenges of synthetic biology, but a significant obstacle is the disconnect between the mathematical theory and the biological reality. Current mathematical understanding of patterning is typically restricted to systems of two or three chemical species, for which equations are tractable. However, when models seek to combine descriptions of intercellular signal diffusion and intracellular biochemistry, plausible genetic networks can consist of dozens of interacting species. In this paper, we suggest a method for reducing large biochemical systems that relies on removing the non-diffusible species, leaving only the diffusibles in the model. Such model reduction enables analysis to be conducted on a smaller number of differential equations. We provide conditions to guarantee that the full system forms patterns if the reduced system does, and vice versa. We confirm our technique with three examples: the Brusselator, an example proposed by Turing, and a biochemically plausible patterning system consisting of 17 species. These examples show that our method significantly simplifies the study of pattern formation in large systems where several species can be considered immobile.},

@article{Goldbeter2018,
abstract = {The goal of this review article is to assess how relevant is the concept of dissipative structure for understanding the dynamical bases of non-equilibrium self-organization in biological systems, and to see where it has been applied in the five decades since it was initially proposed by Ilya Prigogine. Dissipative structures can be classified into four types, which will be considered, in turn, and illustrated by biological examples: (i) multistability, in the form of bistability and tristability, which involve the coexistence of two or three stable steady states, or in the form of birhythmicity, which involves the coexistence between two stable rhythms; (ii) temporal dissipative structures in the form of sustained oscillations, illustrated by biological rhythms; (iii) spatial dissipative structures, known as Turing patterns; and (iv) spatio-temporal structures in the form of propagating waves. Rhythms occur with widely different periods at all levels of biological organization, from neural, cardiac and metabolic oscillations to circadian clocks and the cell cycle; they play key roles in physiology and in many disorders. New rhythms are being uncovered while artificial ones are produced by synthetic biology. Rhythms provide the richest source of examples of dissipative structures in biological systems. Bistability has been observed experimentally, but has primarily been investigated in theoretical models in an increasingly wide range of biological contexts, from the genetic to the cell and animal population levels, both in physiological conditions and in disease. Bistable transitions have been implicated in the progression between the different phases of the cell cycle and, more generally, in the process of cell fate specification in the developing embryo. Turing patterns are exemplified by the formation of some periodic structures in the course of development and by skin stripe patterns in animals. Spatio-temporal patterns in the form of propagating waves are observed within cells as well as in intercellular communication. This review illustrates how dissipative structures of all sorts abound in biological systems.This article is part of the theme issue 'Dissipative structures in matter out of equilibrium: from chemistry, photonics and biology (part 1)'.},

Reverse engineering of network architecture from their functions has proved fruitful to classify and predict the structure and function of molecular networks, suggesting new experimental tests and biological predictions. We present $\phi$-evo, an open-source program to evolve in silico phenotypic networks performing a given biological function. We include implementations for evolution of biochemical adaptation, adaptive sorting for immune recognition, metazoan development (somitogenesis, hox patterning), as well as Pareto evolution. We detail the program architecture based on C, Python 3, and a Jupyter interface for project configuration and network analysis. We illustrate the predictive power of $\phi$-evo by first recovering the asymmetrical structure of the lac operon regulation from an objective function with symmetrical constraints. Second, we use the problem of hox-like embryonic patterning to show how a single effective fitness can emerge from multi-objective (Pareto) evolution. $\phi$-evo provides an efficient approach and user-friendly interface for the phenotypic prediction of networks and the numerical study of evolution itself.},

abstract = {Many physical systems are described by nonlinear differential equations that are too complicated to solve in full. A natural way to proceed is to divide the variables into those that are of direct interest and those that are not, formulate solvable approximate equations for the variables of greater interest, and use data and statistical methods to account for the impact of the other variables. In the present paper the problem is considered in a fully discrete-time setting, which simplifies both the analysis of the data and the numerical algorithms. The resulting time series are identified by a NARMAX (nonlinear autoregression moving average with exogenous input) representation familiar from engineering practice. The connections with the Mori-Zwanzig formalism of statistical physics are discussed, as well as an application to the Lorenz 96 system.},

abstract = {Chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are a versatile language for describing the dynamical behaviour of chemical kinetics, capable of modelling a variety of digital and analogue processes. While CRN designs for synchronous sequential logic circuits have been proposed and their implementation in DNA demonstrated, a physical realisation of these devices is difficult because of their reliance on a clock. Asynchronous sequential logic, on the other hand, does not require a clock, and instead relies on handshaking protocols to ensure the temporal ordering of different phases of the computation. This paper provides novel CRN designs for the construction of asynchronous logic, arithmetic and control flow elements based on a bi-molecular reaction motif with catalytic reactions and uniform reaction rates. We model and validate the designs for the deterministic and stochastic semantics using Microsoft's GEC tool and the probabilistic model checker PRISM, demonstrating their ability to emulate the function of asynchronous components under low molecular count.},

abstract = {Oscillations occur in a wide variety of cellular processes, for example in calcium and p53 signaling responses, in metabolic pathways or within gene-regulatory networks, e.g. the circadian system. Since it is of central importance to understand the influence of perturbations on the dynamics of these systems a number of experimental and theoretical studies have examined their robustness. The period of circadian oscillations has been found to be very robust and to provide reliable timing. For intracellular calcium oscillations the period has been shown to be very sensitive and to allow for frequency-encoded signaling. We here apply a comprehensive computational approach to study the robustness of period and amplitude of oscillatory systems. We employ different prototype oscillator models and a large number of parameter sets obtained by random sampling. This framework is used to examine the effect of three design principles on the sensitivities towards perturbations of the kinetic parameters. We find that a prototype oscillator with negative feedback has lower period sensitivities than a prototype oscillator relying on positive feedback, but on average higher amplitude sensitivities. For both oscillator types, the use of Michaelis-Menten instead of mass action kinetics in all degradation and conversion reactions leads to an increase in period as well as amplitude sensitivities. We observe moderate changes in sensitivities if replacing mass conversion reactions by purely regulatory reactions. These insights are validated for a set of established models of various cellular rhythms. Overall, our work highlights the importance of reaction kinetics and feedback type for the variability of period and amplitude and therefore for the establishment of predictive models.},

abstract = {Network reconstruction, i.e., obtaining network structure from data, is a central theme in systems bi-ology, economics and engineering. In some previous work, we introduced dynamical structure functions as a tool for posing and solving the problem of network reconstruction between measured states. While recovering the network structure between hidden states is not possible since they are not measured, in many situations it is important to estimate the minimal number of hidden states in order to understand the complexity of the network under investigation and help identify potential targets for measurements. Estimating the minimal number of hidden states is also crucial to obtain the simplest state-space model that captures the network structure and is coherent with the measured data. This paper characterizes minimal order state-space realizations that are consistent with a given dynamical structure function by exploring properties of dynamical structure functions and developing an algorithm to explicitly obtain such a minimal realization.},

abstract = {Turing patterns (TPs) underlie many fundamental developmental processes, but they operate over narrow parameter ranges, raising the conundrum of how evolution can ever discover them. Here we explore TP design space to address this question and to distill design rules. We exhaustively analyze 2- and 3-node biological candidate Turing systems: crucially, network structure alone neither determines nor guarantees emergent TPs. A surprisingly large fraction ({\textgreater}60{\%}) of network design space can produce TPs, but these are sensitive to even subtle changes in parameters, network structure and regulatory mechanisms. This implies that TP networks are more common than previously thought, and evolution might regularly encounter prototypic solutions. Importantly, we deduce compositional rules for TP systems that are almost necessary and sufficient (≈96{\%} of TP networks contain them, and ≈95{\%} of networks implementing them produce TPs). This comprehensive network atlas provides the blueprints for identifying natural TPs, and for engineering synthetic systems.},

abstract = {This paper presents a model of van der Waals forces in the framework of diffusion–convection equations. The model consists of a nonlinear and degen-erated diffusion–convection equation, which furthermore can be considered as a model for slow perikinetic coagulation. For the analytical investigation, we transform the model to a porous medium equation, which provides us access to the comprehensive analytical results for porous medium equations. Addition-ally, this transformation reveals a new application for porous medium equations. Eventually, we present numerical simulations of the model by solving the porous medium equation. We note that we solve the porous medium equation without any further regularization, which is often applied in this context.},

abstract = {We develop an algorithm for model selection which allows for the consideration of a combinatorially large number of candidate models governing a dynamical system. The innovation circumvents a disadvantage of standard model selection which typically limits the number of candidate models considered due to the intractability of computing information criteria. Using a recently developed sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics algorithm, the sub-selection of candidate models near the Pareto frontier allows feasible computation of Akaike information criteria (AIC) or Bayes information criteria scores for the remaining candidate models. The information criteria hierarchically ranks the most informative models, enabling the automatic and principled selection of the model with the strongest support in relation to the time-series data. Specifically, we show that AIC scores place each candidate model in the strong support , weak support or no support category. The method correctly recovers several canonical dynamical systems, including a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered disease model, Burgers' equation and the Lorenz equations, identifying the correct dynamical system as the only candidate model with strong support.},

abstract = {Synthesizing a genetic network which generates stable Turing patterns is one of the great challenges of synthetic biology, but a significant obstacle is the disconnect between the mathematical theory and the biological reality. Current mathematical understanding of patterning is typically restricted to systems of two or three chemical species, for which equations are tractable. However, when models seek to combine descriptions of intercellular signal diffusion and intracellular biochemistry, plausible genetic networks can consist of dozens of interacting species. In this paper, we suggest a method for reducing large biochemical systems that relies on removing the non-diffusible species, leaving only the diffusibles in the model. Such model reduction enables analysis to be conducted on a smaller number of differential equations. We provide conditions to guarantee that the full system forms patterns if the reduced system does, and vice versa. We confirm our technique with three examples: the Brusselator, an example proposed by Turing, and a biochemically plausible patterning system consisting of 17 species. These examples show that our method significantly simplifies the study of pattern formation in large systems where several species can be considered immobile.},

abstract = {Spatial structure impacts microbial growth and interactions, with ecological and evolutionary consequences. It is therefore important to quantitatively understand how spatial proximity affects interactions in different environments. We tested how proximity influences colony size when either Escherichia coli or Salmonella enterica are grown on various carbon sources. The importance of colony location changed with species and carbon source. Spatially explicit, genome-scale metabolic modeling recapitulated observed colony size variation. Competitors that determine territory size, according to Voronoi diagrams, were the most important drivers of variation in colony size. However, the relative importance of different competitors changed through time. Further, the effect of location increased when colonies took up resources quickly relative to the diffusion of limiting resources. These analyses made it apparent that the importance of location was smaller than expected for experiments with S. enterica growing on glucose. The accumulation of toxic byproducts appeared to limit the growth of large colonies and reduced variation in colony size. Our work provides an experimentally and theoretically grounded understanding of how location interacts with metabolism and diffusion to influence microbial interactions.},

abstract = {Many scientific fields study data with an underlying struc-ture that is a non-Euclidean space. Some examples include social networks in computational social sciences, sensor net-works in communications, functional networks in brain imag-ing, regulatory networks in genetics, and meshed surfaces in computer graphics. In many applications, such geometric data are large and complex (in the case of social networks, on the scale of billions), and are natural targets for machine learning techniques. In particular, we would like to use deep neural networks, which have recently proven to be powerful tools for a broad range of problems from computer vision, natural language processing, and audio analysis. However, these tools have been most successful on data with an un-derlying Euclidean or grid-like structure, and in cases where the invariances of these structures are built into networks used to model them. Geometric deep learning is an umbrella term for emerging techniques attempting to generalize (structured) deep neural models to non-Euclidean domains such as graphs and man-ifolds. The purpose of this paper is to overview different examples of geometric deep learning problems and present available solutions, key difficulties, applications, and future research directions in this nascent field.},

Models have been developed which draw inspiration from computer-vision tasks to identify tracks and estimate track trajectory param-eters in image-like detector data. Additional models have been developed which can operate on a continuous distribution of spacepoint measurements to construct tracks in a structured way.

Tracking mul-tiple objects in real-world scenes involves many challenges, including a) an a-priori unknown and time-varying number of targets, b) a continuous state estimation of all present targets, and c) a discrete combinatorial problem of data association. Most previous methods involve complex models that require tedious tuning of parameters. Here, we propose for the first time, an end-to-end learning approach for online multi-target tracking. Existing deep learning methods are not designed for the above challenges and cannot be trivially applied to the task. Our solution addresses all of the above points in a prin-cipled way. Experiments on both synthetic and real data show promising results obtained at ≈300 Hz on a standard CPU, and pave the way towards future research in this direction.},

These networks typically contain positive and negative feedback loops, which are responsible for switch-like and oscillatory dynamics, respectively. Many computing systems rely on switches and clocks as computational modules. While the combination of such modules in biological systems leads to a variety of dynamical behaviours, it is also driving development of new computing algorithms. Here we present a historical perspective on computation by biological systems, with a focus on switches and clocks, and discuss parallels between biology and computing. We also outline our vision for the future of biological computing.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t In this work we present the bulk-surface finite element method (BSFEM) for solving coupled systems of bulk-surface reaction–diffusion equations (BSRDEs) on stationary volumes. Such systems of coupled bulk-surface partial differential equations arise naturally in biological applications and fluid dynamics, for example, in modelling of cellular dynamics in cell motility and transport and diffusion of surfactants in two phase flows. In this proposed framework, we define the surface triangulation as a collection of the faces of the elements of the bulk triangulation whose vertices lie on the surface. This implies that the surface triangulation is the trace of the bulk triangulation. As a result, we construct two finite element spaces for the interior and surface respectively. To discretise in space we use piecewise bilinear elements and the implicit second order fractional-step $\theta$ scheme is employed to discretise in time. Furthermore, we use the Newton method to treat the nonlinearities. The BSFEM applied to a coupled system of BSRDEs reveals interesting patterning behaviour. For a set of appropriate model parameter values, the surface reaction–diffusion system is not able to generate patterns everywhere in the bulk except for a small region close to the surface while the bulk reaction–diffusion system is able to induce patterning almost everywhere. Numerical experiments are presented to reveal such patterning processes associated with reaction–diffusion theory.},

In doing so, a novel 'thermodynamic theory' of ecology is introduced. An important feature, absent in the classical mechanics, of ecological systems is a natural stochastic population dynamic formulation of which the deterministic equation (e.g. the LV equation studied) is the infinite population limit. Invariant density for the stochastic dynamics plays a central role in the deterministic LV dynamics. We show how the conservation law along a single trajectory extends to incorporate both variations in a model parameter $\alpha$ and in initial conditions: Helmholtz's theorem establishes a broadly valid conservation law in a class of ecological dynamics. We analyse the relationships among mean ecological activeness $\theta$, quantities characterizing dynamic ranges of populations A and $\alpha$, and the ecological force F $\alpha$ . The analyses identify an entire orbit as a stationary ecology, and establish the notion of an 'equation of ecological states'. Studies of the stochastic dynamics with finite populations show the LV equation as the robust, fast cyclic underlying behaviour. The mathematical narrative provides a novel way of capturing long-term dynamical behaviours with an emergent conservative ecology.},

Traditional tracking algorithms such as the combinatorial Kalman Filter have been used with great success in LHC experiments for years. However, these state-of-the-art techniques are inherently sequential and scale poorly with the expected increases in detector occupancy in the HL-LHC conditions. The HEP.TrkX project is a pilot project with the aim to identify and develop cross-experiment solutions based on machine learning algorithms for track reconstruction. Machine learning algorithms bring a lot of potential to this problem thanks to their capability to model complex non-linear data dependencies, to learn effective representations of high-dimensional data through training, and to parallelize easily on high-throughput architectures such as GPUs. This contribution will describe our initial explorations into this relatively unexplored idea space. We will discuss the use of recurrent (LSTM) and convolutional neural networks to find and fit tracks in toy detector data.},

The biochemical networks underlying many cellular and metabolic processes are important realizations of such a scenario as typically one is interested in reconstructing the time evolution of unobserved chemical concentrations starting from the experimentally more accessible ones. We present an application to this problem of a novel dynamical mean field approximation, the Extended Plefka Expansion, which is based on a path integral description of the stochastic dynamics. As a paradigmatic model we study the stochastic linear dynamics of continuous degrees of freedom interacting via random Gaussian couplings. The resulting joint distribution is known to be Gaussian and this allows us to fully characterize the posterior statistics of the hidden nodes. In particular the equal-time hidden-to-hidden variance – conditioned on observations – gives the expected error at each node when the hidden time courses are predicted based on the observations. We assess the accuracy of the Extended Plefka Expansion in predicting these single node variances as well as error correlations over time, focussing on the role of the system size and the number of observed nodes.},

Here, we consider polynomial models (e.g., mass-action chemical reaction networks at steady state) and describe a framework for their analysis based on optimization using numerical algebraic geometry. Specifically, we use probability-one polynomial homotopy continuation methods to compute all critical points of the objective function, then filter to recover the global optima.

We demonstrate that in some cases, one can reduce a nonlinear system of equations into a single equation for one of the state variables, and this can be useful for computing the solution when using a variety of analytical approaches. In the case where this reduction is possible, we employ differential elimination to obtain the reduced system. While analytical, the approach is algorithmic, and is implemented in symbolic software such as {\{}$\backslash$sc MAPLE{\}} or {\{}$\backslash$sc SageMath{\}}. In other cases, the reduction cannot be performed strictly in terms of differential operators, and one obtains integro-differential operators, which may still be useful. In either case, one can use the reduced equation to both approximate solutions for the state variables and perform chaos diagnostics more efficiently than could be done for the original higher-dimensional system, as well as to construct Lyapunov functions which help in the large-time study of the state variables. A number of chaotic and hyperchaotic dynamical systems are used as examples in order to motivate the approach.},

abstract = {We develop a systematic analytic approach to the problem of branching and annihilating random walks, equivalent to the diffusion–limited reaction processes 2 A → ∅ and A → (m + 1) A, where m ≥ 1. Starting from the master equation, a field–theoretic representation of the problem is derived, and fluctuation effects are taken into account via diagrammatic and renormalization group methods. For d {\textgreater} 2, the mean–field rate equation, which predicts an active phase as soon as the branching process is switched on, applies qualitatively for both even and odd m, but the behavior in lower dimensions is shown to be quite different for these two cases. For even m, and d near 2, the active phase still appears immediately, but with non–trivial crossover exponents which we compute in an expansion in ǫ = 2 − d, and with logarithmic corrections in d = 2. However, there exists a second critical dimension d ′ c ≈ 4/3 below which a non–trivial inactive phase emerges, with asymptotic behavior characteristic of the pure annihilation process. This is confirmed by an exact calculation in d = 1. The subsequent transition to the active phase, which represents a new non–trivial dynamic universality class, is then investigated within a truncated loop expansion, which appears to give a correct qualitative picture. The model with m = 2 is also generalized to N species of particles, which provides yet another universality class and which is exactly solvable in the limit N → ∞. For odd m, we show that the fluctuations of the annihilation process are strong enough to create a non– trivial inactive phase for all d ≤ 2. In this case, the transition to the active phase is in the directed percolation universality class. Finally, we study the modification when the annihilation reaction is 3 A → ∅. When m = 0 (mod 3) the system is always in its active phase, but with logarithmic crossover corrections for d = 1, while the other cases should exhibit an directed percolation transition out of a fluctuation–driven inactive phase.},

@article{Smith2017,
abstract = {Stochastic chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are complex systems that combine the features of concurrent transformation of multiple variables in each elementary reaction event and nonlinear relations between states and their rates of change. Most general results concerning CRNs are limited to restricted cases where a topological characteristic known as deficiency takes a value 0 or 1, implying uniqueness and positivity of steady states and surprising, low-information forms for their associated probability distributions. Here we derive equations of motion for fluctuation moments at all orders for stochastic CRNs at general deficiency. We show, for the standard base case of proportional sampling without replacement (which underlies the mass-action rate law), that the generator of the stochastic process acts on the hierarchy of factorial moments with a finite representation. Whereas simulation of high-order moments for many-particle systems is costly, this representation reduces the solution of moment hierarchies to a complexity comparable to solving a heat equation. At steady states, moment hierarchies for finite CRNs interpolate between low-order and high-order scaling regimes, which may be approximated separately by distributions similar to those for deficiency-zero networks and connected through matched asymptotic expansions. In CRNs with multiple stable or metastable steady states, boundedness of high-order moments provides the starting condition for recursive solution downward to low-order moments, reversing the order usually used to solve moment hierarchies. A basis for a subset of network flows defined by having the same mean-regressing property as the flows in deficiency-zero networks gives the leading contribution to low-order moments in CRNs at general deficiency, in a 1/n expansion in large particle numbers. Our results give a physical picture of the different informational roles of mean-regressing and non-mean-regressing flows and clarify the dynamical meaning of deficiency not only for first-moment conditions but for all orders in fluctuations.},

The difference between this latter and its equilibrium form represents the minimal work done by the chemostats to bring the network to its nonequilibrium state. It is minimized in nondriven detailed-balanced networks (i.e., networks that relax to equilibrium states) and has an interesting information-theoretic interpretation. We further show that the entropy production of complex-balanced networks (i.e., networks that relax to special kinds of nonequilibrium steady states) splits into two non-negative contributions: one characterizing the dissipation of the nonequilibrium steady state and the other the transients due to relaxation and driving. Our theory lays the path to study time-dependent energy and information transduction in biochemical networks.},

After outlining these methods, we solve the derived PDEs in terms of two path integrals. The path integrals provide distinct exact representations of the conditional probability distribution solving the master equations. We exemplify both path integrals in analysing elementary chemical reactions. Furthermore, we review a method for the approximation of rare event probabilities and derive path integral representations of Fokker-Planck equations. To make our review accessible to a broad community, we have used the language of probability theory rather than quantum (field) theory. The probabilistic structures underpinning various technical concepts, such as coherent states, the Doi-shift, and normal-ordered observables, are thereby made explicit.},

The replicator equation, evolutionary game theory, Markov processes and chemical reaction networks all describe the dynamics of a population or probability distribution. Under suitable assumptions, the distribution will approach an equilibrium with the passage of time. Relative entropy—that is, the Kullback–Leibler divergence, or various generalizations of this—provides a quantitative measure of how far from equilibrium the system is. We explain various theorems that give conditions under which relative entropy is nonincreasing. In biochemical applications these results can be seen as versions of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, stating that free energy can never increase with the passage of time. In ecological applications, they make precise the notion that a population gains information from its environment as it approaches equilibrium.},

abstract = {Some ideas from quantum theory are just beginning to percolate back to classical probability theory. For example, there is a widely used and successful theory of "chemical reaction networks", which describes the interactions of molecules in a stochastic rather than quantum way. Computer science and population biology use the same ideas under a different name: "stochastic Petri nets". But if we look at these theories from the perspective of quantum theory, they turn out to involve creation and annihilation operators, coherent states and other well-known ideas - but in a context where probabilities replace amplitudes. We explain this connection as part of a detailed analogy between quantum mechanics and stochastic mechanics. We use this analogy to present new proofs of two major results in the theory of chemical reaction networks: the deficiency zero theorem and the Anderson-Craciun-Kurtz theorem. We also study the overlap of quantum mechanics and stochastic mechanics, which involves Hamiltonians that can generate either unitary or stochastic time evolution. These Hamiltonians are called "Dirichlet forms", and they arise naturally from electrical circuits made only of resistors.},

abstract = {Light-activated self-propelled colloids are synthesized and their active motion is studied us-ing optical microscopy. We propose a versatile route using different photoactive materials, and demonstrate a multi-wavelength activation and propulsion. Thanks to the photo-electrochemical properties of two semi-conductor materials ($\alpha$-Fe 2 O 3 and TiO 2), a light with an energy higher than the bandgap triggers the reaction of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and produces a chemical cloud around the particle. It induces a phoretic attraction with neighboring colloids as well as an osmotic self-propulsion of the particle on the substrate. We use these mechanisms to form colloidal cargos as well as self-propelled particles where the light-activated component is embedded into a dielectric sphere. The particles are self-propelled along a direction otherwise randomized by thermal fluctuations, and exhibit a persistent random walk. For sufficient sur-face density, the particles spontaneously form " living crystals " which are mobile, break appart and reform. Steering the particle with an external magnetic field, we show that the formation of the dense phase results from the collisions heads-on of the particles. This effect is intrinsically non-equilibrium and a novel principle of organization for systems without detailed balance. Engineering families of particles self-propelled by different wavelength demonstrates a good understanding of both the physics and the chemistry behind the system and points to a general route for designing new families of self-propelled particles.},

The second quantization method is applied to classical many-particle systems.

The method is especially useful for the system in which the number of the composite molecules changes with time, e.g. the system including chemical reaction. 1. Introduction The second quantization method is a very convenient way of treating quantum many-body problems. Almost all quantum many-body theories are written in this representation (Abrikosov et a1 1963). The method, however, is not limited to quantum systems. In fact, creation and annihilation operators +bt(r) and +(r) can be introduced independently of the quantum conditions; they are operationally defined by the following commutation relations: together with the definition of the vacuum state IO),},

abstract = {It is explained how field-theoretic methods and the dynamic renormalisation group (RG) can be applied to study the universal scaling properties of systems that either undergo a continuous phase transition or display generic scale invariance, both near and far from thermal equilibrium. Part 1 introduces the response functional field theory representation of (nonlinear) Langevin equations. The RG is employed to compute the scaling exponents for several universality classes governing the critical dynamics near second-order phase transitions in equilibrium. The effects of reversible mode-coupling terms, quenching from random initial conditions to the critical point, and violating the detailed balance constraints are briefly discussed. It is shown how the same formalism can be applied to nonequilibrium systems such as driven diffusive lattice gases. Part 2 describes how the master equation for stochastic particle reaction processes can be mapped onto a field theory action. The RG is then used to analyse simple diffusion-limited annihilation reactions as well as generic continuous transitions from active to inactive, absorbing states, which are characterised by the power laws of (critical) directed percolation. Certain other important universality classes are mentioned, and some open issues are listed.},

abstract = {The present theoretical framework for the analysis of pattern formation in complex systems is mostly limited to the vicinity of fixed (global) equilibria. Here we present a new theoretical approach to characterize dynamical states arbitrarily far from (global) equilibrium. We show that reaction–diffusion systems that are driven by locally mass-conserving interactions can be understood in terms of local equilibria of diffusively coupled compartments. Diffusive coupling generically induces lateral redistribution of the globally conserved quantities, and the variable local amounts of these quantities determine the local equilibria in each compartment. We find that, even far from global equilibrium, the system is well characterized by its moving local equilibria. We apply this framework to in vitro Min protein pattern formation, a paradigmatic model for biological pattern formation. Within our framework we can predict and explain transitions between chemical turbulence and order arbitrarily far from global equilibrium. Our results reveal conceptually new principles of self-organized pattern formation that may well govern diverse dynamical systems.},

abstract = {Polarity establishment, the spontaneous generation of asymmetric molecular distributions, is a crucial component of many cellular functions. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) undergoes directed growth during budding and mating, and is an ideal model organism for studying polarization. In yeast and many other cell types, the Rho GTPase Cdc42 is the key molecular player in polarity establishment. During yeast polarization, multiple patches of Cdc42 initially form, then resolve into a single front. Because polarization relies on strong positive feedback, it is likely that the amplification of molecular-level fluctuations underlies the generation of multiple nascent patches. In the absence of spatial cues, these fluctuations may be key to driving polarization. Here we used particle-based simulations to investigate the role of stochastic effects in a Turing-type model of yeast polarity establishment. In the model, reactions take place either between two molecules on the membrane, or between a cytosolic and a membrane-bound molecule. Thus, we developed a computational platform that explicitly simulates molecules at and near the cell membrane, and implicitly handles molecules away from the membrane. To evaluate stochastic effects, we compared particle simulations to deterministic reaction-diffusion equation simulations. Defining macroscopic rate constants that are consistent with the microscopic parameters for this system is challenging, because diffusion occurs in two dimensions and particles exchange between the membrane and cytoplasm. We address this problem by empirically estimating macroscopic rate constants from appropriately designed particle-based simulations. Ultimately, we find that stochastic fluctuations speed polarity establishment and permit polarization in parameter regions predicted to be Turing stable. These effects can operate at Cdc42 abundances expected of yeast cells, and promote polarization on timescales consistent with experimental results. To our knowledge, our work represents the first particle-based simulations of a model for yeast polarization that is based on a Turing mechanism.},

abstract = {Synthesizing a genetic network which generates stable Turing patterns is one of the great challenges of synthetic biology, but a significant obstacle is the disconnect between the mathematical theory and the biological reality. Current mathematical understanding of patterning is typically restricted to systems of two or three chemical species, for which equations are tractable. However, when models seek to combine descriptions of intercellular signal diffusion and intracellular biochemistry, plausible genetic networks can consist of dozens of interacting species. In this paper, we suggest a method for reducing large biochemical systems that relies on removing the non-diffusible species, leaving only the diffusibles in the model. Such model reduction enables analysis to be conducted on a smaller number of differential equations. We provide conditions to guarantee that the full system forms patterns if the reduced system does, and vice versa. We confirm our technique with three examples: the Brusselator, an example proposed by Turing, and a biochemically plausible patterning system consisting of 17 species. These examples show that our method significantly simplifies the study of pattern formation in large systems where several species can be considered immobile.},

We assume the distribution of {\$}x{\_}{\{}\backslashell k{\}}, y{\_}{\{}\backslashell k{\}}{\$} to have subexponential decay. In a recent paper, four of the authors recently established that the gap distribution and averaged {\$}k{\$}-point correlation of these matrices were $\backslash$emph{\{}universal{\}} (and in particular, agreed with those for GUE) assuming additional regularity hypotheses on the {\$}x{\_}{\{}\backslashell k{\}}, y{\_}{\{}\backslashell k{\}}{\$}. In another recent paper, the other two authors, using a different method, established the same conclusion assuming instead some moment and support conditions on the {\$}x{\_}{\{}\backslashell k{\}}, y{\_}{\{}\backslashell k{\}}{\$}. In this short note we observe that the arguments of these two papers can be combined to establish universality of the gap distribution and averaged {\$}k{\$}-point correlations for all Wigner matrices (with subexponentially decaying entries), with no extra assumptions.},

abstract = {We discuss a canonical structure that provides a unifying description of dynamical large deviations for irreversible finite state Markov chains (continuous time), Onsager theory, and Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory. For Markov chains, this theory involves a non-linear relation between probability currents and their conjugate forces. Within this framework, we show how the forces can be split into two components, which are orthogonal to each other, in a generalised sense. This splitting allows a decomposition of the pathwise rate function into three terms, which have physical interpretations in terms of dissipation and convergence to equilibrium. Similar decompositions hold for rate functions at level 2 and level 2.5. These results clarify how bounds on entropy production and fluctuation theorems emerge from the underlying dynamical rules. We discuss how these results for Markov chains are related to similar structures within Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory, which describes hydrodynamic limits of such microscopic models.},

abstract = {The present theoretical framework for the analysis of pattern formation in complex systems is mostly limited to the vicinity of fixed (global) equilibria. Here we present a new theoretical approach to characterize dynamical states arbitrarily far from (global) equilibrium. We show that reaction–diffusion systems that are driven by locally mass-conserving interactions can be understood in terms of local equilibria of diffusively coupled compartments. Diffusive coupling generically induces lateral redistribution of the globally conserved quantities, and the variable local amounts of these quantities determine the local equilibria in each compartment. We find that, even far from global equilibrium, the system is well characterized by its moving local equilibria. We apply this framework to in vitro Min protein pattern formation, a paradigmatic model for biological pattern formation. Within our framework we can predict and explain transitions between chemical turbulence and order arbitrarily far from global equilibrium. Our results reveal conceptually new principles of self-organized pattern formation that may well govern diverse dynamical systems.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}How the nervous system internally represents environmental food availability is poorly understood. Here, we show that quantitative information about food abundance is encoded by combinatorial neuron-specific gene-expression of conserved TGF$\beta$ and serotonin pathway components in Caenorhabditis elegans. Crosstalk and auto-regulation between these pathways alters the shape, dynamic range, and population variance of the gene-expression responses of daf-7 (TGF$\beta$) and tph-1 (tryptophan hydroxylase) to food availability. These intricate regulatory features provide distinct mechanisms for TGF$\beta$ and serotonin signaling to tune the accuracy of this multi-neuron code: daf-7 primarily regulates gene-expression variability, while tph-1 primarily regulates the dynamic range of gene-expression responses. This code is functional because daf-7 and tph-1 mutations bidirectionally attenuate food level-dependent changes in lifespan. Our results reveal a neural code for food abundance and demonstrate that gene expression serves as an additional layer of information processing in the nervous system to control long-term physiology.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Roberts2016,
abstract = {As experiments are increasingly able to probe the quantum dynamics of systems with many degrees of freedom, it is interesting to probe fundamental bounds on the dynamics of quantum information. We elaborate on the relationship between one such bound—the Lieb-Robinson bound—and the butterfly effect in strongly-coupled quantum systems. The butterfly effect implies the ballistic growth of local operators in time, which can be quantified with the " butterfly " velocity vB. Similarly, the Lieb-Robinson velocity places a state independent ballistic upper bound on the size of time evolved operators in non-relativistic lattice models. Here, we argue that vB is a state-dependent effective Lieb-Robinson velocity. We study the butterfly velocity in a wide variety of quantum field theories using holography and compare with free particle computations to understand the role of strong coupling. We find that, depending on the way length and time scale, vB acquires a temperature dependence and decreases towards the IR. We also comment on experimental prospects and on the relationship between the butterfly velocity and signaling. In relativistic systems with exact Lorentz symme-try, causality requires that spacelike-separated operators commute. In non-relativistic systems, there is no anal-ogous notion: a local operator V (0) at the origin need not commute with another local operator W (x, t) at po-sition x at a later time t, even if the separation is much larger than the elapsed time |x| ≫ t. This can be un-derstood by considering the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula for the expansion of W (x, t) = e iHt W (x)e −iHt , W (x, t) =},

abstract = {Chaotic dynamics in closed local quantum systems scrambles quantum information, which is man-ifested quantitatively in the decay of the out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOC) of local operators. How is information scrambling affected when the system is coupled to the environment and suffers from dissipation? In this paper, we address this question by defining a dissipative version of OTOC and numerically study its behavior in a prototypical chaotic quantum chain in the presence of dis-sipation. We find that dissipation leads to not only the overall decay of the scrambled information due to leaking, but also structural changes so that the 'information light cone' can only reach a finite distance even when the effect of overall decay is removed. Based on this observation we conjecture a modified version of the Lieb-Robinson bound in dissipative systems.},

In recent years, there has been a boost in the research on quantum systems out of equilibrium. If fifteen years ago hard condensed matter and classical statistical physics remained rather separate research fields, now the focus on several kinds of out of equilibrium dynamics is making them closer and closer. The aim of my lectures was to present to the students the richness of this topic, insisting on the common concepts and showing that there is much to gain in considering and learning out of equilibrium dynamics as a whole research field.},

abstract = {The theory of phase ordering dynamics -- the growth of order through domain coarsening when a system is quenched from the homogeneous phase into a broken-symmetry phase -- is reviewed, with the emphasis on recent developments. Interest will focus on the scaling regime that develops at long times after the quench. How can one determine the growth laws that describe the time-dependence of characteristic length scales, and what can be said about the form of the associated scaling functions? Particular attention will be paid to systems described by more complicated order parameters than the simple scalars usually considered, e.g. vector and tensor fields. The latter are needed, for example, to describe phase ordering in nematic liquid crystals, on which there have been a number of recent experiments. The study of topological defects (domain walls, vortices, strings, monopoles) provides a unifying framework for discussing coarsening in these different systems.},

abstract = {Cells operate in noisy molecular environments via complex regulatory networks. It is possible to understand how molecular counts are related to noise in specific networks, but it is not generally clear how noise relates to network complexity, because different levels of complexity also imply different overall number of molecules. For a fixed function, does increased network complexity reduce noise, beyond the mere increase of overall molecular counts? If so, complexity could provide an advantage counteracting the costs involved in maintaining larger networks. For that purpose, we investigate how noise affects multistable systems, where a small amount of noise could lead to very different outcomes; thus we turn to biochemical switches. Our method for comparing networks of different structure and complexity is to place them in conditions where they produce exactly the same deterministic function. We are then in a good position to compare their noise characteristics relatively to their identical deterministic traces. We show that more complex networks are better at coping with both intrinsic and extrinsic noise. Intrinsic noise tends to decrease with complexity, and extrinsic noise tends to have less impact. Our findings suggest a new role for increased complexity in biological networks, at parity of function.},

@article{Ouldridge2013,
abstract = {Although the thermodynamics of DNA hybridization is generally well established, the kinetics of this classic transition is less well understood. Providing such understanding has new urgency because DNA nanotechnology often depends critically on binding rates. Here, we explore DNA oligomer hybridization kinetics using a coarse-grained model. Strand association proceeds through a complex set of intermediate states, with successful binding events initiated by a few metastable base-pairing interactions, followed by zippering of the remaining bonds. But despite reasonably strong interstrand interactions, initial contacts frequently dissociate because typical configurations in which they form differ from typical states of similar enthalpy in the double-stranded equilibrium ensemble. Initial contacts must be stabilized by two or three base pairs before full zippering is likely, resulting in negative effective activation enthalpies. Non-Arrhenius behavior arises because the number of base pairs required for nucleation increases with temperature. In addition, we observe two alternative pathways-pseudoknot and inchworm internal displacement-through which misaligned duplexes can rearrange to form duplexes. These pathways accelerate hybridization. Our results explain why experimentally observed association rates of GC-rich oligomers are higher than rates of AT- rich equivalents, and more generally demonstrate how association rates can be modulated by sequence choice.},

abstract = {Mathematical models of biochemical reaction networks are important tools in systems biology and systems medicine to understand the reasons for diseases like cancer, and to make predictions for the development of effective treatments. In synthetic biology, for instance, models are used for the design of circuits to reliably perform specialized tasks. For analysis and predictions, plausible and reliable models are required, i.e., models must reflect the properties of interest of the considered biochemical networks. One remarkable property of biochemical networks is robust functioning over a wide range of perturbations and environmental conditions. Plausible mathematical models of such robust networks should also be robust. However, capturing, describing, and analyzing robustness in biochemical reaction networks is challenging. First, including uncertainty in the structures, parameters, and perturbations into the model is not straightforward due to different types of uncertainties encountered. Second, robustness as well as system and thus model properties are often itself inherently uncertain, such as qualitative (i.e., nonquantitative) descriptions. Finally, analyzing nonlinear models subject to different uncertainties and with respect to quantitative and qualitative properties is still in its infancy. In the first part of this perspective article, network functions and behaviors of interest are formally defined. Furthermore, different classes of uncertainties and perturbations in the data and model are consistently described. In the second part, we review frequently used approaches and present our own recent developments for robustness analysis, estimation, and model-based prediction. We illustrate their capabilities to deal with the different types of uncertainties and robustness requirements.},

abstract = {Chemical reaction networks (CRNs) formally model chemistry in a well-mixed solution. CRNs are widely used to describe information processing occurring in natural cellular regulatory networks, and with upcoming advances in synthetic biology, CRNs are a promising language for the design of artificial molecular control circuitry. Nonetheless, despite the widespread use of CRNs in the natural sciences, the range of computational behaviors exhibited by CRNs is not well understood. CRNs have been shown to be efficiently Turing-universal (i.e., able to simulate arbitrary algorithms) when allowing for a small probability of error. CRNs that are guaranteed to converge on a correct answer, on the other hand, have been shown to decide only the semilinear predicates (a multi-dimensional generalization of "eventually periodic" sets). We introduce the notion of function, rather than predicate, computation by representing the output of a function f : ℕ k → ℕ l by a count of some molecular species, i.e., if the CRN starts with x1, {\ldots}, xk molecules of some "input" species X1, {\ldots}, Xk , the CRN is guaranteed to converge to having f(x1, {\ldots}, xk ) molecules of the "output" species Y1, {\ldots}, Yl . We show that a function f : ℕ k → ℕ l is deterministically computed by a CRN if and only if its graph {\{}(x, y) ∈ ℕ k × ℕ l ∣ f(x) = y{\}} is a semilinear set. Finally, we show that each semilinear function f (a function whose graph is a semilinear set) can be computed by a CRN on input x in expected time O(polylog ∥x∥1).},

This analysis reveals that in the presence of cell-autonomous factors, networks can form a pattern with equally diffusing signals and even for any combination of diffusion coefficients. We provide a software (available at http://www.RDNets.com) to explore these networks and to constrain topologies with qualitative and quantitative experimental data. We use the software to examine the self-organizing networks that control embryonic axis specification and digit patterning. Finally, we demonstrate how existing synthetic circuits can be extended with additional feedbacks to form Turing reaction-diffusion systems.

abstract = {Neuroscience has focused on the detailed implementation of computation, studying neural codes, dynamics and circuits. In machine learning, however, artificial neural networks tend to eschew precisely designed codes, dynamics or circuits in favor of brute force optimization of a cost function, often using simple and relatively uniform initial architectures. Two recent developments have emerged within machine learning that create an opportunity to connect these seemingly divergent perspectives. First, structured architectures are used, including dedicated systems for attention, recursion and various forms of short- and long-term memory storage. Second, cost functions and training procedures have become more complex and are varied across layers and over time. Here we think about the brain in terms of these ideas. We hypothesize that (1) the brain optimizes cost functions, (2) the cost functions are diverse and differ across brain locations and over development, and (3) optimization operates within a pre-structured architecture matched to the computational problems posed by behavior. In support of these hypotheses, we argue that a range of implementations of credit assignment through multiple layers of neurons are compatible with our current knowledge of neural circuitry, and that the brain's specialized systems can be interpreted as enabling efficient optimization for specific problem classes. Such a heterogeneously optimized system, enabled by a series of interacting cost functions, serves to make learning data-efficient and precisely targeted to the needs of the organism. We suggest directions by which neuroscience could seek to refine and test these hypotheses.},

abstract = {Transport phenomena in spatially periodic systems far from thermal equilibrium are considered. The main emphasis is put on directed transport in so-called Brownian motors (ratchets), i.e. a dissipative dynamics in the presence of thermal noise and some prototypical perturbation that drives the system out of equilibrium without introducing a priori an obvious bias into one or the other direction of motion. Symmetry conditions for the appearance (or not) of directed current, its inversion upon variation of certain parameters, and quantitative theoretical predictions for specific models are reviewed as well as a wide variety of experimental realizations and biological applications, especially the modeling of molecular motors. Extensions include quantum mechanical and collective effects, Hamiltonian ratchets, the influence of spatial disorder, and diffusive transport.},

Common answers focus on Boltzmann's combinatorial argument, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and maximum entropy con-siderations. We argue that they fail and present a new answer. We char-acterise equilibrium as the macrostate in which the system spends most of its time and prove a new theorem establishing that equilibrium thus defined corresponds to the largest macroregion.

@article{Cameron2001,
abstract = {Polymerization of actin filaments is necessary for both protrusion of the leading edge of crawling cells and propulsion of certain intracellular pathogens [1], and it is sufficient for generating force for bacterial motility in vitro [2]. Motile intracellular pathogens are associated with actin-rich comet tails containing many of the same molecular components present in lamellipodia [3], and this suggests that these two systems use a similar mechanism for motility. However, available structural evidence suggests that the organization of comet tails differs from that of lamellipodia. Actin filaments in lamellipodia form branched arrays [4], which are thought to arise by dendritic nucleation mediated by the Arp2/3 complex [5, 6]. In contrast, comet tails have been variously described as consisting of short, randomly oriented filaments [7], with a higher degree of alignment at the periphery [8], or as containing long, straight axial filaments with a small number of oblique filaments [9]. Because the assembly of pathogen-associated comet tails has been used as a model system for lamellipodial protrusion, it is important to resolve this apparent discrepancy. Here, using a platinum replica approach, we show that actin filament arrays in comet tails in fact have a dendritic organization with the Arp2/3 complex localizing to Y-junctions as in lamellipodia [10]. Thus, comet tails and lamellipodia appear to share a common dendritic nucleation mechanism for protrusive motility. However, comet tails differ from lamellipodia in that their actin filaments are usually twisted and appear to be under significant torsional stress.},

abstract = {Branched actin networks--created by the Arp2/3 complex, capping protein, and a nucleation promoting factor--generate and transmit forces required for many cellular processes, but their response to force is poorly understood. To address this, we assembled branched actin networks in vitro from purified components and used simultaneous fluorescence and atomic force microscopy to quantify their molecular composition and material properties under various forces. Remarkably, mechanical loading of these self-assembling materials increases their density, power, and efficiency. Microscopically, increased density reflects increased filament number and altered geometry but no change in average length. Macroscopically, increased density enhances network stiffness and resistance to mechanical failure beyond those of isotropic actin networks. These effects endow branched actin networks with memory of their mechanical history that shapes their material properties and motor activity. This work reveals intrinsic force feedback mechanisms by which mechanical resistance makes self-assembling actin networks stiffer, stronger, and more powerful.},

@article{Turing1952,
abstract = {It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.},

The patterns appear to be produced by a hexagonal cellular automaton, in which the skin scales are the discrete units. Mathematical theory shows that such a discrete system can emerge from the continuous reactiondiffusion framework when taking into account variations in skin thickness. The intriguing conclusion is that cellular automata are not just abstract computational systems, but can directly correspond to processes generated by biological evolution.},

abstract = {—Compared with artificial neural networks (ANNs), spiking neural networks (SNNs) are promising to explore the brain-like behaviors since the spikes could encode more spatio-temporal information. Although existing schemes including pre-training from ANN or direct training based on backpropagation (BP) make the supervised training of SNNs possible, these methods only exploit the networks' spatial domain information which leads to the performance bottleneck and requires many complicated training techniques. Another fundamental issue is that the spike activity is naturally non-differentiable which causes great difficulties in training SNNs. To this end, we build an iterative LIF model that is friendlier for gradient descent training. By simultaneously considering the layer-by-layer spatial domain (SD) and the timing-dependent temporal domain (TD) in the training phase, as well as an approximated derivative for the spike activity, we propose a spatio-temporal backpropagation (STBP) training framework without using any complicated skill. We design the corresponding fully connected and convolution architecture and evaluate our framework on the static MNIST and a custom object detection dataset, as well as the dynamic N-MNIST. Results show that our approach achieves the best accuracy compared with existing state-of-the-art algorithms on spiking networks. This work provides a new perspective to ex-plore the high-performance SNNs for future brain-like computing paradigm with rich spatio-temporal dynamics.},

abstract = {The organization of computations in networks of spiking neurons in the brain is still largely unknown, in particular in view of the inherently stochastic features of their firing activity and the experimentally observed trial-to-trial variability of neural systems in the brain. In principle there exists a powerful computational framework for stochastic computations, probabilistic inference by sampling, which can explain a large number of macroscopic experimental data in neuroscience and cognitive science. But it has turned out to be surprisingly difficult to create a link between these abstract models for stochastic computations and more detailed models of the dynamics of networks of spiking neurons. Here we create such a link and show that under some conditions the stochastic firing activity of networks of spiking neurons can be interpreted as probabilistic inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Since common methods for MCMC sampling in distributed systems, such as Gibbs sampling, are inconsistent with the dynamics of spiking neurons, we introduce a different approach based on non-reversible Markov chains that is able to reflect inherent temporal processes of spiking neuronal activity through a suitable choice of random variables. We propose a neural network model and show by a rigorous theoretical analysis that its neural activity implements MCMC sampling of a given distribution, both for the case of discrete and continuous time. This provides a step towards closing the gap between abstract functional models of cortical computation and more detailed models of networks of spiking neurons.},

abstract = {Many recent studies have used artificial neural network algorithms to model how the brain might process information. However, back-propagation learning, the method that is generally used to train these networks, is distinctly "unbiological." We describe here a more biologically plausible learning rule, using reinforcement learning, which we have applied to the problem of how area 7a in the posterior parietal cortex of monkeys might represent visual space in head-centered coordinates. The network behaves similarly to networks trained by using back-propagation and to neurons recorded in area 7a. These results show that a neural network does not require back propagation to acquire biologically interesting properties. Recently neural network models have been used to model and predict certain aspects of brain function. A criticism of such models, however, has been their reliance on back propagation, a learning algorithm that has been considered "unbiological" because it requires passage of information backward through synapses and along axons and because it uses error signals that must be precise and different for each neuron in the network. Attempts to implement more biolog-ically realistic forms of back-propagation still require unre-alistic conditions, such as symmetrical feedback pathways that are identical in every way, including strength of the individual synaptic connections (1, 2). Crick has suggested that "what is really required is a brain-like algorithm which produces results of the same general character as back-propagation" (3).

abstract = {Ascribing computational principles to neural feedback circuits is an important problem in theoretical neuroscience. We study symmet-ric threshold-linear networks and derive stability results that go beyond the insights that can be gained from Lyapunov theory or energy functions. By applying linear analysis to subnetworks com-posed of coactive neurons, we determine the stability of potential steady states. We find that stability depends on two types of eigen-modes. One type determines global stability and the other type determines whether or not multistability is possible. We can prove the equivalence of our stability criteria with criteria taken from quadratic programming. Also, we show that there are permitted sets of neurons that can be coactive at a steady state and forbid-den sets that cannot. Permitted sets are clustered in the sense that subsets of permitted sets are permitted and supersets of forbidden sets are forbidden. By viewing permitted sets as memories stored in the synaptic connections, we can provide a formulation of long-term memory that is more general than the traditional perspective of fixed point attractor networks. A Lyapunov-function can be used to prove that a given set of differential equations is convergent. For example, if a neural network possesses a Lyapunov-function, then for almost any initial condition, the outputs of the neurons converge to a stable steady state. In the past, this stability-property was used to construct attractor networks that associatively recall memorized patterns. Lyapunov theory applies mainly to symmetric networks in which neurons have monotonic activation functions [1, 2]. Here we show that the restriction of activation functions to threshold-linear ones is not a mere limitation, but can yield new insights into the computational behavior of recurrent networks (for completeness, see also [3]).},

Trained on many hours of his weekly address footage, a recurrent neural network learns the mapping from raw audio features to mouth shapes. Given the mouth shape at each time instant, we synthesize high quality mouth texture, and composite it with proper 3D pose matching to change what he appears to be saying in a target video to match the input audio track.

We present a deep neural network that sequentially predicts the pixels in an image along the two spatial dimensions. Our method models the discrete probability of the raw pixel values and encodes the complete set of dependencies in the image. Architectural novelties include fast two-dimensional recurrent layers and an effective use of residual connections in deep recurrent networks. We achieve log-likelihood scores on natural images that are considerably better than the previous state of the art. Our main results also provide benchmarks on the diverse ImageNet dataset.

An even greater challenge remained — the ancient game of Go. Despite decades of refinement, until recently the strongest computers were still playing Go at the level of human amateurs. Enter AlphaGo. Developed by Google DeepMind, this program uses deep neural networks to mimic expert players, and further improves its performance by learning from games played against itself. AlphaGo has achieved a 99{\%} win rate against the strongest other Go programs, and defeated the reigning European champion Fan Hui 50 in a tournament match. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in even games, on a full, 19 x 19 board, in even games with no handicap.},

David Silver and colleagues have now produced a system called AlphaGo Zero, which is based purely on reinforcement learning and learns solely from self-play. Starting from random moves, it can reach superhuman level in just a couple of days of training and five million games of self-play, and can now beat all previous versions of AlphaGo. Because the machine independently discovers the same fundamental principles of the game that took humans millennia to conceptualize, the work suggests that such principles have some universal character, beyond human bias.},

Now, with the publication of its full text, these practitioners can go straight to the original material and gain a deeper, practical understanding of this unique mathematical approach to social studies and related fields. In addition, Werbos has provided three more recent research papers, which were inspired by his original work, and a new guide to the field. Originally written for readers who lacked any knowledge of neural nets, The Roots of Backpropagation firmly establishes both its historical and continuing significance as it demonstrates the ongoing value and new potential of backpropagation; creates a wealth of sound mathematical tools useful across disciplines; sets the stage for the emerging area of fast automatic differentiation; describes new designs for forecasting and control which exploit backpropagation; unifies concepts from Freud, Jung, biologists, and others into a new mathematical picture of the human mind and how it works; and certifies the viability of Deutsch's model of nationalism as a predictive tool - as well as the utility of extensions of this central paradigm. Scientists, engineers, statisticians, operations researchers, and other investigators involved in neural networks have long sought direct access to Paul Werbos's groundbreaking, much-cited 1974 Harvard doctoral thesis, The Roots of Backpropagation, which laid the foundation of backpropagation.

abstract = {Hodgkin and Huxley (H-H) fitted their model of voltage-dependent conductances to experimental data using empirical functions of voltage. The thermodynamic H-H model of voltage dependent conductances is more physically plausible, as it constrains and parameterises its empirical fit by assuming that ion channel transition rates depend exponentially on a free energy barrier that in turn, linearly or non-linearly, depends on voltage. The original H-H model contains no explicit temperature terms and requires Q10 factors to describe data at different temperatures. The thermodynamic H-H model does have explicit terms for temperature. Do these endow the model with extrapolation for temperature? We utilised voltage clamp data for a voltage-gated K+ current, recorded at three different temperatures. The thermodynamic H-H model's free parameters were fitted (Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm) to a data set recorded at one (or more) temperature(s). Then we assessed whether it could describe another data set, recorded at a different temperature, with these same free parameter values and its temperature terms set to the new temperature. We found that it could not.},

Maximal independent set (MIS) selection is a fundamental distributed computing procedure that seeks to elect a set of local leaders in a network. A variant of this problem is solved during the development of the fly's nervous system, when sensory organ precursor (SOP) cells are chosen. By studying SOP selection, we derived a fast algorithm for MIS selection that combines two attractive features. First, processors do not need to know their degree; second, it has an optimal message complexity while only using one-bit messages. Our findings suggest that simple and efficient algorithms can be developed on the basis of biologically derived insights.},

Biologists rely on computational methods to analyze and integrate large data sets, while several computational methods were inspired by the high-level design principles of biological systems. Recently, these two directions have been converging. In this review, we argue that thinking computationally about biological processes may lead to more accurate models, which in turn can be used to improve the design of algorithms. We discuss the similar mechanisms and requirements shared by computational and biological processes and then present several recent studies that apply this joint analysis strategy to problems related to coordination, network analysis, and tracking and vision. We also discuss additional biological processes that can be studied in a similar manner and link them to potential computational problems. With the rapid accumulation of data detailing the inner workings of biological systems, we expect this direction of coupling biological and computational studies to greatly expand in the future.},

abstract = {Actin filaments polymerizing against membranes power endocytosis, vesicular traffic, and cell motility. In vitro reconstitution studies suggest that the structure and the dynamics of actin networks respond to mechanical forces. We demonstrate that lamellipodial actin of migrating cells responds to mechanical load when membrane tension is modulated. In a steady state, migrating cell filaments assume the canonical dendritic geometry, defined by Arp2/3-generated 70° branch points. Increased tension triggers a dense network with a broadened range of angles, whereas decreased tension causes a shift to a sparse configuration dominated by filaments growing perpendicularly to the plasma membrane. We show that these responses emerge from the geometry of branched actin: when load per filament decreases, elongation speed increases and perpendicular filaments gradually outcompete others because they polymerize the shortest distance to the membrane, where they are protected from capping. This network-intrinsic geometrical adaptation mechanism tunes protrusive force in response to mechanical load.},
